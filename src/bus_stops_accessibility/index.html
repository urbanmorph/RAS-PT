Accessibility in Byataryanapura (Work In Progress)</h1>
<p>Byataryanapura is one of the fastest growing suburbs toward the
north-east of Bengaluru. With its proximity to the airport and high
number of ongoing developments, it is poised to be a key region of
future growth in the city. Developments which are already partially
complete, including Manyata Tech Park, Bhartiya City and the Bangalore
Aerospace SEZ have attracted a huge number of companies and
people into the area. Over the next few years, Karle Town Centre SEZ,
L&amp;T Tech Park and the opening of Terminal 2 of the Kempegowda
International Airport, among a number of other developments, will
only speed up the growth of population in the area.</p>
<p>However, like many other emerging areas of Bengaluru, a lot of the
growth has happened without the consequent construction and maintenance
of infrastructure, be it water, sewage or transport. With the
construction of the Blue Line of Namma Metro now ongoing, there is an
opening for transit infrastructure in Byataryanapura to have an
efficient public transport network. The opening of the Blue Line is
still a few years away, but if reliable, accessible and safe public
transport is to become a reality, a single metro line wonâ€™t be
sufficient. BMTC buses carry an overwhelming majority of public
transport passengers in the city, but BMTC services in emerging areas
like Byataryanapura are very limited and unreliable.</p>
<p>Take for example, Reva College, an educational institution with a
student population of over 10,000. Due to the limited BMTC coverage in
the area, many private buses are required for the daily commute of the
students and staff at Reva College. On this page, are a set of
visualizations that show the extent of BMTC coverage in the area using
demographic data and BMTC bus stop data. The data will hopefully convey
the massive mismatch between population growth and public transport
growth in the area. To accomodate and include the new people moving into
these areas, it is imperative that more buses and routes are started by
the BMTC in the area to improve coverage and make the growth more
sustainable.</p>

<li>Compare v/s recommended number of buses/people or people/buses</li>
<li>More visualizations</li>
<li>Use an example like Manyata/Reva/Bhartiya in detail, with
