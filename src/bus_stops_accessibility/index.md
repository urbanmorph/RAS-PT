# Bus Accessibility in Byataryanapura (Work In Progress)

Byataryanapura is one of the fastest growing suburbs toward the north-east of Bengaluru. With its proximity to the airport and high number of ongoing developments, it is poised to be a key region of future growth in the city. Developments which are already partially complete, including Manyata Tech Park, Bhartiya City and the Bangalore Aerospace SEZ have attracted a huge number of companies and people into the area. Over the next few years, Karle Town Centre SEZ, L&T Tech Park and
the opening of Terminal 2 of the Kempegowda International Airport, among a number of other developments, will only speed up the growth of population in the area.

However, like many other emerging areas of Bengaluru, a lot of the growth has happened without the consequent construction and maintenance of infrastructure, be it water, sewage or transport. With the construction of the Blue Line of Namma Metro now ongoing, there is an opening for Byataryanapura to have an efficient public transport network. The opening of the Blue Line is still a few years away, but if reliable, accessible and safe public transport is to become a reality, a single metro line won't be
sufficient. BMTC buses carry an overwhelming majority of public transport passengers in the city, but BMTC services in emerging areas like Byataryanapura are very limited and unreliable.

Take for example, Reva College, an educational institution with a student population of over 10,000. Due to the limited BMTC coverage in the area, many private buses are required for the daily commute of the students and staff at Reva College. On this page, are a set of visualizations that show the extent of BMTC coverage in the area using demographic data and BMTC bus stop data. The data will hopefully convey the massive mismatch between population growth and public transport growth in the
area. To accomodate and include the new people moving into these areas, it is imperative that more buses and routes are started by the BMTC in the area to improve coverage and make the growth more sustainable.

### TODO:

* Compare v/s recommended number of buses/people or people/buses
* More visualizations
* Use an example like Manyata/Reva/Bhartiya in detail, with corresponding BMTC route networks
* GDP/Economic Loss due to bad public transport (LA vs Tokyo/Time spent in traffic)
